Logic to implement :

    [X]  If current user is pub and socket is connected, user cannot create another party unless they are sub.
    [X]  A user can only be connected once, no matter how many browser tabs they have open. Can be identified via their authentication token.
    [X]  Must work in a clustered environment. Individual server nodes should be able to go down without affecting the rest of the system.
    [X]  Authorization tokens should be passed via a dedicated authentication event after the connection is established.

Server :


Client :
    [X]  Fix the FaBars padding on collapsed sidebar.
    [X]  Add CSS transition for the sidebar content. Icons, buttons, etc.
 
Done :
    [X]  Subscriber should Pause vid when Publisher pauses vid. This change could be on client or server side.
    [X]  If room pub leaves, then randomly choose new pub. Update the client accordingly.
    [X]  When client closes tab that socket should disconnect.
    [X]  Restrict number of allowed users in a room.
    [X]  Write function to display user data when user icon clicked.
    [X]  Write function to query display room members when members icon clicked.
    [X]  Listen to server on whether or not pub disconnected and you are new pub.
    [X]  Write function to emit user data for all users in a room. Used to display room members on client side.
