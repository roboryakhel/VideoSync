    [X]     Add group chat feature.
    [X]     Add voice chat feature.
    [X]     A user can only be connected once, no matter how many browser tabs they have open. Can be identified via their authentication token.
    [X]     Must work in a clustered environment. Individual server nodes should be able to go down without affecting the rest of the system.

Client :
    [X]  Fix the FaBars padding on collapsed sidebar.

    [X]  Write function to query display room members when members icon clicked.
    [X]  Listen to server on whether or not pub disconnected and you are new pub.
